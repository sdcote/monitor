# Coyote Monitor

The Coyote Monitor is a framework for running components which monitor the state of other components.

Generic probes and sensors can be written which will use the facilities in this framework to record the results and perform some set of actions when conditions dictate.

## Prerequisites:

  * JDK 1.6 or later installed
  * Ability to run bash (*nix) or batch (Windows) scripts
  * Network connection to get the dependencies (there are ways around that)
  * Assumes you do not have gradle installed (if you do, you can replace gradlew with gradle)
